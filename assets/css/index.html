			<a>My hours are flexible I will go anywhere and do what it takes to develop data driven decision making that leverages real information to make optimized decisions. 

As a Digital Analytics Professional I am in charge of delivering real time, big-data, web analytics to key marketing, merchandising, and operations managers. I am fluent in Google's web analytics tool-set. My business intelligence is often pointed to as evidence of either success or failure on part of the organization or of the organization's affiliate's. I can work on the fly and desperately enjoy the work of delivering relevant, concise, and accurate data to key decision makers. 

As an integral part of the Energy Sourcing Department at Georgia-Pacific I served as an Energy Sourcing Analyst. I alone was charged with the task of modernized all things regarding natural gas contracts. I was in charge of requesting, authoring, negotiation, approval, amending, audits, reports, and renewals. I demanded excellence in my primary responsibilities: contract administration, contract life-cycle management, and total-cost-of-sourcing.

I also worked for Georgia-Pacific LLC in Atlanta, GA as a Supply Chain Analyst. I analyzed customer Cost to Serve Data and consulted with Customer Logistics Managers, Regional Team Leads, and Innovation Teams to deliver cost saving perspectives to key decision makers. I accomplished this by tracking metrics for products like Angel Soft, Sparkle, Brawny, and many other private label brands.</a>
